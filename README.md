[![Travis](https://travis-ci.org/pmoelgaard/email-address-validation.svg)](Travis)

Node JavaScript wrapper for [the mailboxlayer API](https://mailboxlayer.com/).

Supports both traditional callbacks and Promises/A+.

---

## Installation
	npm install email-address-validation [--save]


## Configuration

Before using the mailboxlayer API client you have to setup your account and obtain your API Access Key.  
You can get it by signing up at [https://mailboxlayerlayer.com/product](https://mailboxlayer.com/product).

---

## Usage

The general API is documented here: [https://mailboxlayer.com/documentation](https://mailboxlayer.com/documentation).  
You can find parameters, result set definitions and status codes documented here as well.


### Setup

	var API = require('email-address-validation');
	var api = new API({
    	access_key: [ACCESS_KEY],
    	catch_all: [0|1] (Optional, defaults to 1)
    	secure: [true|false] (Optional, defaults to false)
	});

#### Optional Parameters

##### catch_all (only available for Basic, Pro and Enterprise accounts)
Boolean value to indicate if checks should also include checks for catch all.

##### secure (only available for Basic, Pro and Enterprise accounts)
Boolean value to indicate if the calls to the API should use a secure protocol or insecure (HTTP/HTTPS). Defaults to false (HTTP, insecure).

---

## Callbacks vs. Promises

The Promises/A+ implementation used for this is this excellent bare bones library:  
[https://www.npmjs.com/package/promise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/promise)

The language-detection library supports either mode and use of either one is not mutually exclusive to the alternative, so it's possible to use one exclusively or a combination, even in the same call, both the callback will be called and the promise handlers invoked.

---

## API Overview
All endpoints in the public API is available through this library.

- check

---

## Check
Takes an email  and checks the email against the API.

###### Define Query

	var query = {
    	email: 'this.is.a@test.io'
	};

###### Simple Request (using Callback)

	api.check(query, function (err, result) {
    	if (err) {
        	return console.log('Check Callback (Error): ' + JSON.stringify(err));
    	}
	    console.log('Check Callback (Result): ' + result.length);
	});
    
###### Response
```
{
  "email": "this.is.a@test.io",
  "did_you_mean": "",
  "user": "this.is.a",
  "domain": "test.io",
  "format_valid": true,
  "mx_found": true,
  "smtp_check": true,
  "catch_all": false,
  "role": true,
  "disposable": false,
  "free": false,
  "score": 0.96
}  
```

---

## Example Application

In the [rootdir]/example directory there is a fully functional application which runs all requests against all the endpoints in the API, the examples above can be seen there as source code.

The example application uses a process.env variable to hold the access key.

For running in development environments, it's easy to use the [https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to load variables from a local file into the environment.

---

## Tests

The tests are written for any NodeJS testing library, but has been run and targeted at the [https://mochajs.org/](https://mochajs.org/) testing library.

In order to run the tests, the following environment variables needs to be set:

```
ACCESS_KEY = [access_key] (This account needs to be Basic, Pro or Enterprise)
ACCESS_KEY_FREE = [access_key_for_a_free_account]
```
